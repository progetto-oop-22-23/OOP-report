\chapter{Analysis}
\section{Requirements}

HOMER (HOMe EmulatoR) is an emulated domotic controller connected to lights, windows, and other domestic facilities.
The smart environment is mananged through a dashboard which allows the user to control devices, monitor sensors and electrical consumptions.
Each device should support updates in variable time units.
Some devices should act in a somewhat random way (but still predictable), while others should be fully deterministic.

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The software should allow creating and controlling lots of different devices, such as:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Lights
		\item Electrical outlets
		\item Doors, Locks and windows
		\item Temperature changer devices
	\end{itemize}
	\item Devices can be added/removed at runtime.
	\item A logger is needed in order to allow users (and possibly machines) to keep track of state changes.
	\item The software should have graph views for temperature and air quality state.
	\item The users should be able to see electrical consumption.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-Functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Should performant enough to run on a desktop/laptop.
	\item User interface should be intuitive and user-friendly
	\item The project should be portable, and work on Windows, MacOS and Linux devices.
\end{itemize}

\section{Analysis and domain model}

The application will emulate a domotic environment, some smart devices and facilities monitoring.
Smart devices are common domestic devices as lights, electrical outlets, windows, doors and various sensors 
for monitoring indoor temperature and air quality along with electrical absorption.
The user will interact with the devices via the controller through a dashboard.

The main challenge will be modelling the communication between the controller 
and the different devices, which can have very different states.

\section{Architecture}

HOMER is built on the MVC (model-view-control) architecture. 
In order to start JavaFX, JFXapplication will be our application's entry point.
JFXApplication will instance the controller, which is responsible for getting inputs from the views,
and updating the model consequently. The controller also sends back state updates to the various views.
The model part is composed by the devices and electrical outlets.


\section{Detailed Design}
Problem: Sending updates from the view to the controller. 
We need a common way for all the UI components to send the same kind of updates to the controller without repeating code.
We also want the controller to have more control over what is actually execute, and when it is executed. So the controller acts as a receiver.
All the commands implement an execute method, that is called inside the controller.
Solution: Used the command pattern

\chapter{Development}
\section{Automated testing}
We used unit testing especially on the model to prevent regressions, and we tested observable behaviour only.
Our unit test suite uses JUnit.
We decided not to test UI components, since our UI is not the main foucs,
and other areas of the model would benefit more from more granular testing. 
Tested classes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Temperature
	\item DurationConverter
	\item ElectricalMeter
	\item Lights
	\item Outlets
	\item temperaturechangers
	\item Logger
\end{itemize}

\section{Workflow}
The first step in our process was domain analysis, and then the insights gained were applied by modeling 
the project's main interfaces by using UML.
We used Git as our DCVS. We used gitflow and feature branching, with dev as our development branch,
and main as our stable branch for releases. The workflow is based on pull requests and forks, allowing for asynchronous feedback when needed.
Group meeting were only needed to discuss refactors.

\chapter{User guide}

In the main tab, there are 3  tabs: devices, scheduler and graphs.
In the devices tab, there is an add window button. After selecting a device,
it will be created (and will be inserted at the bottom). Each device has a remove device button
used to disconnect it, and may have some kind of utility to set its state. \newline
At the bottom there are the scheduler buttons, which allow the user to set scheduler speed, pause it and resume it.
In the scheduler view, the user can select time slices for heating. \newline % TODO this needs to be explained better.
In the graph view, temperature and air quality stats are displayed (provided the user already connected a related sensor).

%TODO: describe outlet view.
