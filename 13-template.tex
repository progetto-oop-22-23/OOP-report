\chapter{Analysis}
\section{Requirements}

HOMER (HOMe EmulatoR) is an emulated domotic controller connected to lights, windows, and other domestic facilities.
The smart environment is managed through a dashboard which allows the user to control devices, monitor sensors and electrical consumptions.
Each device should support updates in variable time units.
Some devices should act in a somewhat random way (but still predictable), while others should be fully deterministic.

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The software should allow creating and controlling lots of different devices, such as:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Lights
		\item Electrical outlets
		\item Doors
		\item Locks
		\item Windows
		\item Blinds
		\item Temperature changer devices
	\end{itemize}
	\item Devices can be added/removed at runtime.
	\item A logger is needed in order to allow users to keep track of state changes. It also makes debugging easier for developers.
	\item The software should have graph views for temperature and air quality state.
	\item The users should be able to see electrical consumption.
	\item The users should be able to set the desired temperature in the course of the day.
	\item The users should be able to view the trend of temperature, consumptions and air quality.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-Functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Should be performant enough to run on a desktop/laptop.
	\item User interface should be intuitive and user-friendly
	\item The project should be portable, and work on Windows, MacOS and Linux devices.
\end{itemize}

\section{Analysis and domain model}
\subsection{Domain analysis}

The application will emulate a domotic environment, some smart devices and facilities monitoring.
Smart devices are common domestic devices as lights, electrical outlets, windows, doors and various sensors 
for monitoring indoor temperature and air quality along with electrical absorption.
The user will interact with the devices via the controller through a dashboard.

The main challenge will be modelling the communication between the controller 
and the different devices, which can have very different states.

\chapter{Design}
\section{Architecture}

HOMER is built on the MVC (model-view-controller) architecture. 
The controller is responsible for getting inputs from the views, and updating the model consequently.
The controller also sends back state updates to the various views.
The model part is composed by the devices and electrical outlets. Each device has a state of its own, that
the controller gets and sends to the views. 
Each view is independent from each other.
When a view commands a state update, the controller processes the change and sends an update signal to all the views.

\section{Detailed Design}
Problem: Sending updates from the view to the controller. 
We need a common way for all the UI components to send the same kind of updates to the controller without repeating code.
We also want the controller to have more control over what is actually execute, and when it is executed. So the controller acts as a receiver.
All the commands implement an execute method, that is called inside the controller.
Solution: Used the command pattern, which allows 
different views to send the same updates to the controller, avoiding code duplication
Commands that create devices need to be displayed to the user, so we created a new interface called CreateDeviceCommand
and we decided to opt for string representations instead of enums to allow for further future expansibility.

\chapter{Development}
\section{Automated testing}
We used unit testing especially on the model to prevent regressions, and we tested observable behaviour only.
Our unit test suite uses JUnit.
We decided not to test UI components, since our UI is not the main focus,
and other areas of the model would benefit more from more granular testing. 

Tested classes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Temperature
	\item DurationConverter
	\item Outlets
	\item ElectricalMeter
	\item Light
	\item temperaturechangers
	\item Logger
\end{itemize}

\section{Workflow}
The first step in our process was domain analysis, and then the insights gained were applied by modeling 
the project's main interfaces by using UML.
We used Git as our DCVS. We used gitflow and feature branching, with dev as our development branch,
and main as our stable branch for releases. The workflow is based on pull requests and forks, allowing for asynchronous feedback when needed.
Group meetings were only needed to discuss refactors.

\chapter{User guide}

The main view is divided in two sections horizontally. \newline
Above there are 3 tabs: DEVICES, SCHEDULER and GRAPHS. \newline
At the bottom there is the SIMULATION information and control section, which reports the simulation time and the time rate, and allows the user to pause and resume the simulation, or change the time rate. \newline
In the DEVICES tab, there is an add window button. After selecting a device,
it will be created (and will be inserted at the bottom). Each device has a remove device button
used to disconnect it, and may have some kind of utility to set its state. \newline
In the SCHEDULER tab, the user can select the desired temperature range in time of the day intervals (schedule). \newline
No interval can be overlapping with another. The application will prevent the user from trying to do so, and notify them. \newline
When a schedule is present, the domotic controller will try to attain the desired parameters, provided that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A thermometer is connected
	\item For heating: a heater is connected
	\item For cooling: an air conditioner is connected
\end{itemize}
In the GRAPHS tab, the user can visualize temperature, global consumption, and air quality parameters, logged at intervals of 1 hour. \newline
In order to visualize temperature and air quality parameters, either a thermometer or an air quality sensor, respectively, should be connected.

The electrical meter view is relatively basic, consisting of a table with two columns. \newline
The first column indicates the name of the Outlet, while the second column displays its State (i.e., the power absorption in watt-hours). \newline
At the bottom of the table, there are two buttons: one to add a new outlet and another to remove the most recently added outlet 
(the adding and removal process is organized in a LIFO structure). \newline
Additionally, the state column can be sorted in either ascending or descending order by clicking on the column heading.
%TODO: describe outlet view.
