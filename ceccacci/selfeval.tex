\subsection{Michele Ceccacci}
This project definitely improved my teamworking and software architecture skills. 
This was my first time participating in a greenfield project this big, and my first time 
taking architectural decisions that would carry over the whole software's lifecycle. 
In my previous work experience and open source contriubtions, i was more focused on  adding new features 
to an existing product or bugfixing, rather than actual softare architecture.
I was familiar proficient at git, but i still made some occasional mistakes.
I think that working in a team without a more senior figure acting as lead definitely 
made me more self reliant, and allowed me to dig deeper into problems.
