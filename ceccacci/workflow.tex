\begin{itemize}
	\item Add/remove devices interface.
	\item Actuated devices view
	\item Airconditioning/Heating view and model implementations
	\item Air quality view and model implmentation
	\item Application Logger 
\end{itemize}

I contributed to the architecture of DeviceViewer and the Controller class.
I also worked on most of the device views, and AddDeviceView, and the components that
where reused in the whole UI such as SliderComponent.
