    \item Utility classes
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{homer.common.temperature.*} 
		\item \texttt{homer.common.time.DurationConverter}
    \end{itemize}
	\item Model
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{homer.model.temperaturechangers.*}
		\item \texttt{homer.model.airquality.*}
	\end{itemize}
	\item Logger
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{homer.view.logger.*}
	\end{itemize}
	\item JavaFx view
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{homer.view.javafx.deviceview.*}
		\item \texttt{homer.view.javafx.JFXDeviceViewer} Responsible for most of the implementation
		\item \texttt{homer.view.javafx.*} Did most of the work on JFXDeviceViewer and everything in the other classes.
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

I contributed to the architecture of DeviceViewer and the Controller class.

I also have minor contributions to the controllerImpl class, namely sending updates on temperature and air quality changes.
Whenever i noticed repeated code in the codebase i took charge of implementing a common solution, such as DurationConverter.
