\subsection{Michele Ceccacci}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Optional}s were used when the value could either be present or not
	\item \textbf{Streams} were used to access and modify data, especially data that used optional types
	\item \textbf{Records} to make data immutability more explicit, and to avoid reimplementing constructors/HashCode methods
	\item \textbf{Lambda} functions and functional interfaces were used to make code more readable and often complemented streams 
	\item \textbf{JavaFX} was used to develop the main view.
\end{itemize}
