\subsection{Alessandro Monticelli}
I believe this course has been the most informative since the start of my academic path. \newline
I thoroughly enjoyed attending the classes, and even though I had to miss some for personal reasons, I learned a lot from all three professors.\newline
I appreciated the emphasis placed on the art of clean code and programming patterns. \newline
The project itself was immensely helpful because I had never worked in a team or created a project of this size from scratch. \newline
I learned many new things during these months of hard work and became very curious about the Gradle tool, which I think is really powerful. 
Although I was already proficient with Git, I had never used a strict workflow like the one we decided to follow at the start of the project, 
and I found it to be incredibly helpful. Overall, I think the general workflow allowed us to work in a highly efficient manner.
