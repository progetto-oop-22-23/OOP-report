\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Generics} Use of generics was fundamental for keeping a clean clode and reach high extensibility.
    \item \textbf{Optional}
    \item \textbf{Stream} The use of streams allowed me to keep my code clean and readable, I made large use of this Java feature, 
                            which I think is among the most interesting.
    \item \textbf{Lambda}
    \item \textbf{JavaFX}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Scene Builder} It proved to be a fundamental tool for building the view. I quickly learned to use it, 
                                            and it allowed me to create a consistent UI without too much hassle.
            \item \textbf{FXML} I really like the idea of creating the UI through a structured markup language. I think it's functional and clean.
                                I also appreciate the way the view is managed through a controller class.
