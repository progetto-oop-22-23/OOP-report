I contributed to the architecture of the Electrical Meter and the simulation of electrical consumption 
(through the PoweredDevice interface, along with PoweredDeviceInfo). \newline
I also contributed to the mathematical and theoretical modeling of the physics 
(e.g., functions for changes in temperature and electrical consumption over time) 
and helped establish the architecture of the application during the analysis phase.
