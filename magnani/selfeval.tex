\subsection{Simone Magnani}

Although this was not my first project of such dimensions to be designed from
scratch, it was the first one to be made in a team, and the first one where I
had the awareness that certain design choices had a name and are commonly used.
Altough the minimum requirements were met, I expected to reach further.
I now feel to have grasped how git works and am comfortable in using it in collaborative projects.
I will definitely carry over the knowledge I have acquired in architecture design and design patterns
onto my future projects.
