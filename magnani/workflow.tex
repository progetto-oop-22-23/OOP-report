I have contributed to the establishing of the architecture eg. \texttt{Device} and \texttt{Controller} interfaces.

When I had some ideas that could be used by someone else eg. \texttt{Environment, Bounds, Limit},
I would open a pull request, which allowed everyone to be aware of it, and who could chime in and provide their feedback.

I have also contributed in minor parts to the entrypoint and \texttt{Controller} implementation, for the integration of my code,
and \texttt{JFXDeviceViewer}.
